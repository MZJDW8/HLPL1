In this homw work i first made a function to calculate the factorial of the integers.
And then in the main program i introduce 4 integers w,x,y,perm,comb.
where perm and comb are reffered to permutation and combination respectively.
And "w" will be used soon. After that we ask the user to input two integers x and y.
afterwards we will check if x is lees than y becasue in the formula of permutation if
X is smaller than Y it will not work. Then we will use the formula of permutation and combination to find the results.
After as per asked in the homework the user can ask to see the permutation or combination or he/she can ask for both.
there we will ask our user what he/she wants to know and will countinue as per requierd .
I used the if else statement because it ws eassy to use in this case.
after every thing is done I would like to disscus about the Try-Catch statement .
As you might know i was unable to attend this week lecture but i still wanted to do my homework.
I was still a bit confused about the Try-Catch statement, So i did some research and did as i understand it.
As i saw the recorded lectrue you used "error" comand to catch the error , but i was unable to find it/use it.
I hope you understand ,But still if anything is wrong with this program please do let me know i will still try to make it more efficient.
THANK YOU!
